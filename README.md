# Praise Apple Bot

An IRC bot built solely to Praise Apple. Built because I need to learn Swift for
my Capstone class, and I usually build IRCbots to get a hang of the string
handling and classes.

This is made in Swift and only runs on OS X so far because ~~Apple is incapable
of competently porting software~~ Linux is inferior to the Holy OS X.

## Features
- Joins a channel and says "Praise Apple"
- When it hears ".praise" in a chat, says "Praise Apple"
